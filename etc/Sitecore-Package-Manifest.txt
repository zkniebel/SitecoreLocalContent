The following item paths are included in the package. I have not committed the items to source control, as I want to keep this module ready to go for use with any or no serialization tool (e.g. TDS, Unicorn, none):

- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Tags/Item Creation/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Tags/Item Layout/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Item Hierarchy Operators/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Macros/ItemHierarchy/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Elements/Item Layout – Custom/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Elements/Item Hierarchy – Custom/**
- /sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Definitions/Elements/Item Creation – Custom/**
